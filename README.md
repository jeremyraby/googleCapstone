## About

Welcome to my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate! For this project, I wanted to explore how casual riders of a bike share company use the bikes and app differently from annual members, with the goal of helping the marketing team convert more casual riders to members.

Using my newly acquired Excel skills, I dove deep into the data and uncovered fascinating insights about rider behavior. Along the way, I learned how to use Excel to its fullest potential and discovered some of its limitations.

Unfortunately, the final Excel file is too large to display on GitHub, but don't worry! I've saved it to [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnHkLfM3SO3zggPlKv_uk1ZFWzcU?e=e1MfCo), and I've included screenshots of the [dashboard](https://github.com/jeremyraby/googleCapstone/blob/main/cyclisticDashboardThumnail.jpg) and my [work](https://github.com/jeremyraby/googleCapstone/blob/main/cyclisticSummaryScreenshot.jpg) to give you a taste of what I accomplished.

Check out my dashboard to see how I organized the data and visualized my findings. If you're interested in digging deeper, you can also download the [data files](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) in .zip format.

Overall, I'm thrilled with what I've accomplished with this project, and I hope my insights can help the bike share company improve their offerings and attract more members.

## Findings

After analyzing the data from 2022, I found that casual riders tend to take longer rides than annual members, with an average ride time of 28:10 compared to 12:20 seconds for annual members. However, annual members are more consistent in their usage of the service.

When it comes to the busiest months, June through September take the cake. And if you're wondering which day of the week is the busiest, it's Thursday! But that's not the whole story. Saturday is the busiest day for casual riders, while Thursday is the busiest day for annual members.

And what kind of bikes are people riding? Electric bikes are the most popular choice among both casual riders and members.
